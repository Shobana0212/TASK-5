## 🔍 EDA Highlights
- Overview using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()`
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms and boxplots for numerical distribution
  - Countplots for categorical variables
  - Pairplot and heatmap to explore feature relationships
  - Scatterplots for age vs fare with survival color coding
- Key observations and insights noted below each visual

## 📊 Key Insights
- Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
- Passengers in 1st class had higher chances of survival.
- Younger passengers tended to survive more.
- Fare and class were important indicators of survival.
